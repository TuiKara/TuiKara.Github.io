    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <p><strong>Question:</strong> How should I position the phone in my pocket?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Place your iPhone vertically deep in your pocket. It's best if your pocket is not too wide and spacious, so that your iPhone doesn't slip or slide around. </p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Do I have to activate each segment of a salah separately?</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, once a salah is selected, you don't need to activate each segment separately. The app automatically counts all segments for a salah. For example, if you perform the Dhuhr salah, the app will count all 4 + 4 + 2 blocks in one go.</p>
